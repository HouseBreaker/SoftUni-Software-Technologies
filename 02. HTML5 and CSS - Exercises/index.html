					<h3 class="title">Work begins on HTML 5.1</h3>

					<p class="subtitle">Posted on 22-May-2016 by Svetlin Nakov</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>HTML5 was released in 2014 as the result of a concerted effort by the W3C HTML Working Group. The intention was then to begin publishing regular incremental updates to the HTML standard, but a few things meant that didnâ€™t happen as planned. Now the Web Platform Working Group (WP WG) is working towards an HTML5.1 release within the next six months, and a general workflow that means we can release a stable version of HTML as a W3C Recommendation about once per year.</p>

						<p> The core goals for future HTML specifications are to match reality better, to make the specification as clear as possible to readers, and of course to make it possible for all stakeholders to propose improvements, and understand what makes changes to HTML successful.</p>

						<p> The plan is to ship an HTML5.1 Recommendation in September 2016. This means we will need to have a Candidate Recommendation by the middle of June, following a Call For Consensus based on the most recent Working Draft.</p>

						<p>To make it easier for people to review changes, an updated Working Draft will be published approximately once a month. For convenience, changes are noted within the specification itself.</p>
